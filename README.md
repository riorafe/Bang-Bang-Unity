# Bang-Bang-Unity
This is the first unity-based game that I made with some of my friends in college

We modify the FPS template from Unity tutorials in some aspect which is:
1. Modify the map

map changes: color, material, shape, world map

2. Modify the game objective

kill enemies and go to the next level -> score-oriented (endless killable enemy) 

3. Adding new enemy

We add a missile that following player

4. Adding respawn system

Respawn system including spawnPoint and algorithm

5. Minor changes

We did many minor changes in order for game balancing
